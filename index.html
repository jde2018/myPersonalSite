      <p><em>Role: Application Developer</em></p>
      <p>I am currently an application developer that has a Master's degree in Biomedical engineering. When I was failure analysis engineer
        for an international medical device company, I developed an Access database for my department.
        During this project, I found that I absolutely loved to code. I know it's a huge jump
        in careers, but it was absolutely worth it!</p>
      <p>I am now an application developer for a company that specializes in MS Access and .NET core development.
        Like other software developers, I am always excited to learn new technologies. For my company I am
        trying to transition into the web development side of things.</p></td>
